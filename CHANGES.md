# Recent Changes Documentation

This document summarizes the recent changes made to the Storekoto project as of March 5, 2026.

## Overview
The changes primarily focus on enhancing the product management system with image upload capabilities, improving tenant administration features, and fixing minor issues in migrations and seeders.

## Detailed Changes

### Product Management Enhancements
- **Product Image Upload**: Added support for uploading product images in the vendor dashboard.
  - Updated `ProductController.php` to validate and store image files (JPG, PNG, WEBP up to 2MB).
  - Modified `Product.php` model to include `image_path` in fillable attributes.
  - Enhanced `Products.vue` component with image preview, upload controls, and display in product table.
  - Created new migration `2026_03_05_064330_add_image_to_products_table.php` to add `image_path` column to products table.

### Tenant Administration Improvements
- **Login Form Refactor**: Simplified `LoginAdminTenant.vue` to use `useForm` hook instead of the Form component for better consistency.
- **Seeder Enhancements**:
  - Updated `TenantRolesSeeder.php` to clear cached permissions and specify guard_name for roles.
  - Modified `TenantStoreAdminSeeder.php` to set `email_verified_at` timestamp when creating admin users.
- **User Table Extension**: Added new migration `2026_03_04_165931_add_phone_to_tenant_users_table.php` to include phone number field for tenant users.

### Backend Fixes and Adjustments
- **Vendor Approval Process**: Commented out the automatic copying of vendor user to tenant in `VendorController.php` (likely for testing or adjustment).
- **Migration Fixes**: Updated exception classes in `2026_03_04_000003_create_permission_tables.php` to use fully qualified names.
- **Route Imports**: Added necessary imports to `tenant.php` routes file.
